# Classification Task: Predicting Diabetes Risk

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models to predict whether an individual is at risk of diabetes based on key health indicators. By following this tutorial, you will learn how to preprocess data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance using standard metrics. The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. Preprocess and explore the dataset to identify patterns and relationships.
2. Build and evaluate predictive models using:
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **Random Forest**
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. Understand model performance using metrics such as:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
   - AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve)
4. Gain insights into the strengths and limitations of each model.

## Methodology

### **1. Data Exploration**
- Analyze the dataset for missing or improbable values (e.g., zero glucose levels).
- Visualize feature distributions and pairwise relationships using histograms and scatter plots.
- Use correlation matrices to identify significant relationships between features and the target variable.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- Replace zero or missing values in critical columns (e.g., `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`) with column medians.
- Split the dataset into:
  - **Training Set (80%)**: For model building.
  - **Testing Set (20%)**: For performance evaluation.
- Normalize features using **StandardScaler** to ensure comparability, especially for SVM.

### **3. Model Building**
- Train three models on the preprocessed data:
  - **Logistic Regression**: A simple, interpretable baseline model.
  - **Random Forest**: An ensemble model combining multiple decision trees.
  - **SVM**: Optimizes decision boundaries in high-dimensional space.

### **4. Model Evaluation**
- Use the following metrics to evaluate model performance:
  - **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.
  - **Precision**: Correctness of positive predictions.
  - **Recall**: Ability to identify all positive cases.
  - **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  - **AUC**: Measures the area under the ROC curve.
- Visualize results using confusion matrices and ROC curves for each model.

### **5. Insights**
- Summarize model performance to compare strengths and weaknesses.
- Highlight feature importance for interpretability, especially for Random Forest.
